            <h4>Basic Instructions</h4>
            <p>
            Hover over the images to expand them. Click an image to zoom into that cell to see the kinds and quality of images from that spot in the world. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Drag the slider forward to view more recent images, and backward to view older images. Drag it all the way to the left to view data from all years at once (only available in world overview, not a cell). 
            </p>
            <p>
            To search by tags, start typing in the input box or select a tag from the word cloud to automatically add it to the box. Multiple tags may be used by separating them with commas, and you can select whether you want to search "first tag AND second tag, etc." by picking "and", or "first tag AND second tag, etc." with "or". Then click the "search" icon to apply the filter. The above operations will now be performed on this filtered dataset. 
            </p>
            <h4>Concept Statement</h4>
            <p>We are going to use the Flickr dataset to create a way to visualize what kinds of photos are being taken around the world at different points in time. First we will use the geolocation data to sort the whole set of images into the grid shown in the mockup. We can further sort the images by the date they were taken, and also by the machine tags generated by Flickr.</p>
            <p>We will be using the geolocation coordinates to get a grouping of photos for each grid area. We will then further filter each set of images by date, according to the date selected on the slider. We will then choose an image from the remaining set of photos based on the follower numbers and favorite number in the dataset.</p>
            <p>The way we will choose the images based on their tags will change, based on whether the user has entered anything into the search box. If the user has entered nothing, we will find the picture with highest value of follower and favorite number to display.  If the user has entered something to search by, we will only show images with that selected tag with the highest value of follower and favorite number. For search function, we will display the suggest tags and histograms using the cloud for each year’s tags and for each geo grid if the user select a specific geo location. In this manner, the user can pick up some interesting tags instead of typing random things. We also allow user to “and” and “or” multiple tags to get a desired set of images.</p>
            <p>To display the images, we will have two levels of zoom. The first is an overview, showing an image for each grid cell that represents the images in that cell. The presense or lack thereof will indicate whether there exist images in that cell. We visualize the number of images in a cell by changing the color of a box by the image, and the quality of the image, calculated from the followers and favorites, with the opacity of that box. The second level aims to visualize the data within one of the grid cells. By zooming in, we will display each image as a dot on the map according to their geolocation coordinates. Each dot will be colored according to the number of favorites on the image, and the opacity set by the number of followers for the user.</p>
