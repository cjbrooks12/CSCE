A very common error, I have often made a vector then tried to iterate across the whole vector but had it end up iterating one subscript off, leading to either a compile-time error or a runtime error: compile-time if I used a correct loop to initialize a vector and then an incorrect for-loop to analyze it; run-time if the vector was never initialized until ran and initialized by user input, and then analyzed with an incorrect for-loop.
