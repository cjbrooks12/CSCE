So in other words, before parking, I have to turn the steering wheel, 180 degrees.  After putting it on, it works well.  It's fairly stable, holds my iPad and allows me to type on the keyboard or play games and such.  It's lightweight and holds it's grip okay.  It's not great but it does work and in my vehicle it looks just like it does in the picture.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Multi-Functional Portable Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray - Gray Table/Car Vehicle Seat Portable Mount Tray Laptop Notebook Table Eating Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414V-KP4Q3L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
