My oldest is very hard on his stuff and these might last a whole year before he destroys it, but the other 2 are more typical in their treatment of school supplies and this item can last them a few years. I think there is a more 'heavy duty' version of this item, but these work well too. I like how the rings inside are slanted so the paper lays flat. There are 2 plastic pockets on the inside. You can even customize the spine, as well as the front and back. (but the back has rivets, so it is harder to put in a picture but still works fine). Basic binder, in basic white. Currently my daughter has a photo of kittens and hers and my son has a photo of an airplane. They love to customize their binders every year! I really like this product.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Economy View Binder with 2-Inch Round Ring, White, Pack Of 4 (19202)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BOlG5BbLL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
