Not sure that it would work well with a laptop like in the photo. I only gave it four starts because I ended up having to return it because it didn't fit my steering wheel well. I have a 2016 Mercedes C300 sport, and it fit the steering wheel, but it was tight getting it on and off and I was afraid that it will ruin the leather. I tried it out on a 2015 Hyundai Veloster r-spec, just to see if it would work, but it didn't fit that one either. It was too big. The steering wheel was too thin so the holder wouldn't stay on the steering wheel. Overall, I love the idea of the product, just didn't work out well for me.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Ipad Laptop/Eating Steering Wheel Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gu166efrL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
