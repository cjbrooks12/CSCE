Simply push the green button (the stem) down to open the claw, insert into the strawberry, release the button, twist and pull the hull out.  So simple!  Works like a charm, each and every time.  And it is adorable and very easy to find in my gadget drawer.  No more poking myself with the cheap tweezer type product or cutting off more of the \"good\" strawberry than I want to.Recently tried it on tomatoes and works amazingly well to core cherry tomatoes for stuffing as little appetizers also.  What a fun and functional product!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n StemGem Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TL1TBYz1L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
