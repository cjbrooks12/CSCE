This is a VERY flimsy binder for contents such as product brochures, etc.  The cardboard inside the cover is very thin.  If you need this product to put regular bond paper in then it will probably work for you.  For us, to give this to an account, it would be embarrassing because it comes across as \"cheap.\"  The product title is correct:  It is an ECONOMY binder.  Please buy with that in mind.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Economy View Binder with 2-Inch Round Ring, White, Pack Of 4 (19202)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BOlG5BbLL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
