Every day I'd look down at all these unsliced strawberries and bemoan my lot in life. The slices just weren't even and it took so long to slice all those berries. Now that I have the MSC Joie Simply Slice Strawberry Slicer my life has been changed forever! The MSC Joie Simply Slice Stawberry Slicer does exactly as it said it would- it slices strawberries. With all the extra time in the morning saved I've begun to pick up new hobbies and activities that truly enrich and fulfill my life. I started learning French because hey- we all know French is a great way to attract the opposite gender. Once I mastered French I moved on and learned Spanish too. With those two down I've even begun learning dead languages. The MSC Joie Simply Slice Stawberry Slicer even gave me so much time I've taken up Krav Maga and Mauy Thai kickboxing, must be all the energy I've saved from not having to slice every piece myself and eating all those berries.I mean, I still haven't managed to get a date which is why it's only four out of five stars but... guys like dead languages and women that can grapple men twice their size, right?","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Simply Slice Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ejvDkkEBL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
