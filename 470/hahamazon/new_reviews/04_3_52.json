They are 4\" binders, are sturdy, have three huge \"D\" rings, and an easy to use latch to open it. They have two pockets on the front and back inside covers and three places where you can display the contents of the binder (the front, rear and the spine). I purchased these binders to put study material in, includind page dividers. With a lot of binders, the page divider tabs would stick out, not with these. I usally need two binders, not this time one will definitely be enough....They are Huge!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy Duty 2 inch Black View Binder with One Touch EZDTM Ring","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-RDeZUMbL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
