My daughter used it for about a year to keep her 175-page, loose-leaf Radiology Clinical Comp Book in. It has stood-up to the daily commute from home to school, from school to clinic, from clinic to home. Even after a year of daily use, the binder's EZD rings remain perfectly aligned, and continue to open and close easily and effortlessly. Pages lay flat and don't get tossed around like they do in traditional round-ring binders. An additional benefit of the EZD rings is that they place less stress on the punched-hole edges of the sheets. This drastically reduces the need to use hole reinforcements. Another feature of this binder allows for writing on sheets while in the binder when placed on your lap or a small, classroom sized desk. The front cover and spine open and wrap around the back cover. Thus, this binder takes up half the space of a traditional binder. I highly recommend this binder based on its quality, functionality, and durability.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty View Binder with 2 Inch  One Touch EZD Ring, White, 1 Binder (79792)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31AY%2BQcC2qL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
