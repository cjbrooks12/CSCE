It's sharp, looks nice, is reasonably sized, and easy to hold onto.  It was packaged very nicely, both the original plastic packaging as well as the shipping box thanks to Amazon prime.  I had a new quart of strawberries ready to test this on, and from the time I started opening the box my things were shipped in, it took 9 minutes to get the stems off of the whole quart of berries.  Not bad, actually fantastic considering that I have Parkinson's tremors.  I'd happily pay three times the price for this tool!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412yjfCuJ5L._AC_UL160_SR95,160_.jpg"}
