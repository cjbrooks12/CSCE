They keep sticking out over the edges, even getting away in some cases.

And maybe switch to the Trap Her, Keep Her.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2-Inch Slant Ring, Holds 8.5 x 11-Inch Paper, Blue, 1 Binder (17034)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41A3oo4EIVL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
