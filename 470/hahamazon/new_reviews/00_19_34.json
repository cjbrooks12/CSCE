Was on a mission to find another slicer that didn't have as many moving parts and less to break.  Found this slicer and thought, this could work.  Started to get just the slicer and found this set for a couple dollars more.  I really didn't need another collander but considered it \"free\".  It's a hard plastic and I prefer a softer plastic with some \"give\" to it.  The huller I was unsure of until I tried it.  AMAZING!!  Beats my beloved Tupperware hullers!  The slicer (the main reason for the purchase) is everything I wanted.  Simple to use, easy to clean, not much to break (a hinge) and cuts right through the berries quick and clean!  So, I'm glad I bought this set.  :)","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie 3-Piece Strawberry Colander, Huller and Slicer Set","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YigJg%2BNUL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
