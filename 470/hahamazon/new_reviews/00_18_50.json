Two earlier devices of different design worked poorly, but this one is quick and easy. It removes strawberry stem and leaves with a simple twist of the wrist. A paring knife removes too much if you intend leaving the \"berry\" shape for garnish.Combined with a strawberry/mushroom slicer (not a wire type egg slicer) this tool can prepare a half-gallon of berries for a whole bunch of shortcakes with less time and effort than would be the case with a knife.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412yjfCuJ5L._AC_UL160_SR95,160_.jpg"}
