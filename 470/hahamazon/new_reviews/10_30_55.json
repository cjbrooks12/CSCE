With the JL421, surrendering to the Germans has never been easier. Since there is no weaponry installed we don't even have to pretend to fight back against the Germans. All you have to do is run up a white flag, hand the keys to the nearest German officer, and head off to the nearest cafe to await our allies to bail us out. This tank makes surrendering so easy that we may even surrender to Switzerland next week!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XCJQ2Q2SL._SX300_QL70_.jpg"}
