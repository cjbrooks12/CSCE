There are many 5-star reviews, and mine will surely add nothing of note.  I remember a similar gadget my mom had when I was a kid.  It worked just ok, but the edges around the rim of the spoon part were not sharpened, nor serrated.  This new gadget is indeed sharpened, and it is small (which is entirely a good thing!).  I am able to hull a big bowl full of strawberries very quickly, while minimizing the amount of fruit lost, and cutting down on the mess of leaves/stems.  Don't hesitate, buy this!  It is made in China, but is heavy duty, and should withstand many years of abuse.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412yjfCuJ5L._AC_UL160_SR95,160_.jpg"}
