Since mafia hooligans stole all of our equipment to sell to Kyrgyzstani rebels, we have been looking for a low-cost alternative to the T-80 Main Battle Tank. After successful trials at a facility in Moscow, this so-called \"Badonkadonk\" was approved for use in the Chechen theatre. Initial reports were favorable, but then somebody noticed that the tank lacked a cannon, treads, and armor, and possessed the engine of an electric bicycle. It did, however, have an excellent audio system, but this failed to compensate for its disappointing 100% mortality rate. Recommended only for use against Lithuanians.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XCJQ2Q2SL._SX300_QL70_.jpg"}
