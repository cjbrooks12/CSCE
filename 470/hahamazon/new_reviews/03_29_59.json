You know, the ones with the mountain of flaming cars, crashed airliners, capsized cruise ships, etc., so I'm kinda embarrassed that I ended up buying one. But I'm a editorial photographer and sometimes I need to sit in my car at halftime or after an event and use a laptop to transmit photos in order to make tight deadlines.The black Cutequeen Eating/Laptop Steering Wheel Desk is just the ticket for supporting my laptop while I work on photos. The flip side is also nicely shaped for fast food boxes and drink if I ever get stuck waiting out in the boonies. I needed to rotate the steering wheel 180 degrees on my 2012 Ford Fusion to attach the desk securely, but I'm pleased with the overall appearance, usefulness and construction.So, five stars. But be sure to read the funny reviews on this critter; they'll make you fall out of your chair!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Cutequeen Trading car 1pcs Eating/Laptop Steering Wheel Desk Black(pack of 1)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KM9zL8vzL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
