We've been on the lookout for cooking tools that will allow him to be more independent in the kitchen. While we have an adapted cutting board, using a knife on such tiny and \"rolly\" objects is difficult for him to steady and slice safely. We've found the slicester to be a great help for making things like jam and even slicing olives (as you'll see in the review).","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LXsBc0ERL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
