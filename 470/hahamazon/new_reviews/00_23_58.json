I lost it and purchased a new one recently and as others pointed out it is of much lower quality and the blades now blend when inserted into a strawberry and they also damage the strawberry.  In other words the way this tool is currently produced it is useless.Either someone is unloading a cheap knockoff on amazon or the product has changed manufacturer and is using a different type of metal which easily bends and makes the product worthless.So the overwhelming positive reviews on this product reflect the original product which was a definite must have 5 star and the latest negative reviews reflect the latest manufacturing standards.  As I don't know which one I'll be getting I can no longer buy this product on amazon.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n StemGem Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TL1TBYz1L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
