A heavier person would not be able to use this desk for a laptop because the steering wheel is too close to your body even when the seat its all the way back. Tilting the steeping wheel up helps but will make the keyboard difficult to use. The smaller the user, the better. It is a snug fit for me at 5'10\", 190 lbs in a mid sized car.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Multi-Functional Portable Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray - Gray Table/Car Vehicle Seat Portable Mount Tray Laptop Notebook Table Eating Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414V-KP4Q3L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
