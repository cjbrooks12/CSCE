I wanted the binders to all match because, as a teacher, I will need to consult the binders over time.  None of the binders arrived in good condition.  All have bubbles in the plastic that covers the chipboard.  The first set was adequate; however the second set arrived with cracked spines and folded and bent on the front and back.  I contacted amazon for a replacement set.  The replacement set had 3 adequate binders and one with a bent spine.  I called and requested a 25% off discount so as not to pay for the damaged binder.  Amazon did give me the discount, and now 7 of my 8 binders will match - but I don't want to start from scratch!  Class starts in a few days.  I would only buy these binders if you want to store something on a shelf.  They are definitely not good for a student who needs to carry a binder around with them.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Wilson Jones Round Ring View Binder, 1.5 Inch, Basic, 362 Series, Customizable, White, 4 Pack (W70362-34WPP)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pprQHFnPL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
