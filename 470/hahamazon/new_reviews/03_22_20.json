It is precisely as it has been pictured; they show it accurately and honestly, and I give them credit for that.  But be aware that it is precisely & accurately depicted; and some people might tend to label it SMALL.It's really small.  For a tablet it will be ideal, and I would think a soft drink cup and a donut would be just fine, but a laptop?!  I doubt it.Anyway - nothing nasty or negative - just be aware of what you're buying.  If you have any doubts, cut out a piece of cardboard and do a little eyeballing in your car.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Ipad Laptop/Eating Steering Wheel Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gu166efrL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
