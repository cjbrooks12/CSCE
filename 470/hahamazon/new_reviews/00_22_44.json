I was so disappointed. I purchased slicer six weeks ago and have used it three times. This morning when using it for the fourth time the housing broke and the blades fell out.  Amazon did not support return or replacement because it was past the 30 day return window. Seriously, how often do you think the average person slices up strawberries that a customer only has 30 days to find out that an item is poorly made?  This item was sold by Amazon and they claimed they would support it 100% - for 30 days. So now I have to deal with the manufacturer to be reimbursed in someway.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LXsBc0ERL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
