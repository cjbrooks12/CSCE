This huller may work well for the huge, hard strawberries at the supermarket, but it does not work on ripe local berries, which are the only kind worth eating in my opinion.  Local strawberries are smaller than the monsters you see at the supermarket, and are brought ripe to the Farmer's Market or from a U-Pick farm.  This huller smushes and destroys those ripe berries, no matter how careful you are with it.  I bought this little device to aid in canning strawberry jam, I was really looking forward to speeding up the process of removing the stems.  Unfortunately after ruining several berries I went back to using a paring knife.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n StemGem Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TL1TBYz1L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
