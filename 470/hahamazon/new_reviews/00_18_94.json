It's size is of great merit as it takes up little space. It is easy to find per it's color and washes very easily. We use it for strawberries and tomatoes. The teeth are very strong and plentiful enough to quickly core. We have yet to see any discoloration due to washing in the dishwasher.It's original price of $9.95 was a bit steep for such a tiny tool and I admit I waited for it to go below $5 which made it worth every penny.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412yjfCuJ5L._AC_UL160_SR95,160_.jpg"}
