{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FVUKKO","name":"14_30_85","review":"I must have been thinking \"what the hell?\" when I bought it on one of my drunk internet shopping sprees. Usually those are bad decisions which I end up returning. I'm not sure how I even came across this device.When it came to my doorstep I scratched my head, asking myself, \"Oh, good lord, what did I buy now?\" When I cracked it open I had a good laugh. I couldn't resist testing it out.The strangest thing happened. It went off. Like, it REALLY went off. There was no one around. My cat was in the far back room. So I shut it off and waited for my fiance to come home. I was with him when he turned it on and sure enough it acted possessed again. He was about to tinker with it to see where the problem was when I went outside to check our mailbox.The moment I left the front door, it stopped. When I came back in, it lit up like the fourth of July.Like any concerned person, I was wondering if there was something wrong with me. After several doctor appointments, cat scans, and psychological exams, I could think of no one else to turn to. Except the church.The Church of Scientology, that is.I found out I'm not alone. There are about 8 million of us thetans out there waiting to find our way back home, to each other.My life is forever changed. Now when I look into the sky, I don't ask \"are we alone?\" Instead I look at the stars and see my long-lost home, from which I and my people were exiled.Earth is a prison. Xenu be damned. If I ever find his wretched soul I will kill him.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"UFO Detector - Internal magnetometer interfaced with microcontroller for 24 hour/7 days a week monitoring for magnetic anomalies that have been reported with many UFO sightings","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413xdZdfwlL._SY300_QL70_.jpg"}
