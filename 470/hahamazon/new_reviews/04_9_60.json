The other features I appreciate include the covers allow you to slip in  your own artwork or pictures.  Ditto for the spine.  Each inside cover has a plastic half folder.  These half pockets on the inside covers are much more useful than I initially realized.  I use them  to hold stuff that doesn't go into the three holes but really belongs to the binder, like an adjunct poster, or brochures.I use the outside of the binder to hold my sons class schedule that I have laminated.  Slip it right in and I printed & laminated one out for each binder, so he at least will always know where he SHOULD be (whether or not he actually gets there is a whole other review...).","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Economy View Binder with 2-Inch Round Ring, White, Pack Of 4 (19202)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BOlG5BbLL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
