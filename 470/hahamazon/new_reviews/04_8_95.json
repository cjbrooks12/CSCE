I was worried that they wouldn't work for what I wanted, but they ended up working perfectly.  I expect to be able to use these for a long period of time and I like them better than the ones that I had purchased elsewhere.  The design on the inside has a space in front of the rings which I like more than the binders without the space.  Mine did not come with the papers in the slots (the green Basic Binder sheets) which was great so I didn't have to remove them all!  The rings are not overly tough and I can open and close it easily.  Overall I'm very pleased with these.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Wilson Jones Round Ring View Binder, 1.5 Inch, Basic, 362 Series, Customizable, White, 4 Pack (W70362-34WPP)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pprQHFnPL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
