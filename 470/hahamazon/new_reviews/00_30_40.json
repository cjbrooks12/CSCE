Well...my parole officer won't allow me to be around knives.  \"Shoot it with a gun!\"  Background check...HELLO!  I had to resort to carefully attempt to slice those bananas with my bare hands.  99.9% of the time, I would get so frustrated that I just ended up squishing the fruit in my hands and throwing it against the wall in anger. Then, after a fit of banana-induced rage, my parole officer introduced me to this kitchen marvel and my life was changed.  No longer consumed by seething anger and animosity towards thick-skinned yellow fruit, I was able to concentrate on my love of theatre and am writing a musical play about two lovers from rival gangs that just try to make it in the world.  I think I'll call it South Side Story.Banana slicer...thanks to you, I see greatness on the horizon.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VTJj4VuVL._SY300_QL70_.jpg"}
