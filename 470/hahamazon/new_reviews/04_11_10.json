The first sleeve measures about 2\" high and the one behind it measures about 4\" high. This is great if you need to separate loose leaf papers but don't want to punch holes in them.The second great advantage of this binder is the way the rings close. Instead of the seraded mouth-like connect between the two ends of the rings, it has been replaced by a dot and hole connection. This has made it much easier to flip pages and now pages rarely get caught.Last, the EZD technology is incredible. With the touch of a finger, and very little effort, the binder opens. This is true even if the binder is filled with papers, which typically makes it more difficult to open on other binders.All in all, if you're ok with spending a little more for the Rolls-Royce of binders that has all the fixings, this is the one!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty View Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Gray (79402)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41F1dfUVq4L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
