I love this item and it is one of the best purchases ive made on amazon. You must becareful while using it, because like a knife, you can hurt yourself. I would use a knife protectant glove. It helped me tremendously.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412yjfCuJ5L._AC_UL160_SR95,160_.jpg"}
