{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013D8VDQ","name":"17_30_67","review":"Well, I finally decided to spring for the Sigma 200-500 f/2.8. For under $30,000 I couldn't pass up the deal. I know, carrying a 37lb lens around may seem like a chore, but the savings in gas to drive to photo shoots more than compensates for it.  I actually do most of my Florida and Georgia area outdoor wedding and landscape shoots from my rooftop now.  The IQ is tack-sharp even wide open at 1000mm (w/ 2x converter, obviously) The issue I had, was when the FBI and Homeland security showed up at my house.  I was shooting a wedding in downtown Orlando, which is only about 30 miles away, from my roof.  The house was surrounded and guns drawn on me.  You see, I live near enough to a major airport that the neighbors mistook it's green color and imposing size as some sort of ground to air missile launcher.  I would strongly consider coloring it a light color to minimize thermal expansion during the day, and marking the side \"Not A Stinger Missile\". Also, it is a nice walk around lens for family trips to the zoo. Low light performance is superb.  Most photos can be taken without flash, on a moonless night, following a massive power outage, by simply lighting a fart during the exposure.  Experiment with differing brands of beans, as it affects the color temperature of the raw shot.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Sigma 200-500mm f/2.8 APO EX DG Ultra-Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uAOqLVCOL._SY300_QL70_.jpg"}
