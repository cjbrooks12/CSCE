{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013D8VDQ","name":"17_30_99","review":"I finally got permission to take this lens with me on my last mission to do maintenance on the Hubble Space Telescope. In order to justify the extra weight on-board the space shuttle, I had to agree to eat nothing but rice cakes during the mission, but it was totally worth it. I love taking photos of the earth from the window of the orbiter, and the zoom was so fantastic I finally have photographic evidence that my neighbors dog has been taking a dump on my front lawn. On the mission we took the lens out of the Hubble to clean it, and while we were wiping it off, we all wondered how the Sigma f/2.8 would compare to the normal telescope lens. I space-walked back to the shuttle and grabbed it from my camera bag (it's much easier to maneuver in zero-g) and when I got back we snapped it in place. Turned the telescope a few degrees, and snapped a picture. Once the photo came through, it was completely black, which was a bit of a shock. Turns out we focused past the edge of the observable universe. We were having fun at this point, so we dialed it back a bit, changed the angle again, and took another one. This time we found the origin point of the Big Bang. After a few laughs, we pulled it out,  and put the Hubble lens back in. Before we left, we decided to put the f/2.8 on my regular camera and take a selfie in space. That one didn't come out too well because you couldn't see any of our faces because the molecular polycarbonate structures in our helmet windows were in the way. O well, you can't always have it all.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Sigma 200-500mm f/2.8 APO EX DG Ultra-Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uAOqLVCOL._SY300_QL70_.jpg"}
