Before this, I have been using the Avery WorkSaver Big Tab Insertable Dividers, 5-Tabs, 1 Set (11109) which I've been satisfied with.What I like about the 11900 dividers is that they are all-plastic. They can be wiped clean and the colors are nicer to look at than the manilla paper of the 11109s. The 11900 all-plastic dividers cost more so hopefully they will last longer than the 11109s, but it'll be awhile before I can comment on that.Please note that the 9\" width includes the 0.5\" wide tabs.So far I'm satisfied with this purchase.PROS:- Nice colors- Can be wiped clean- Hopefully will last longer than paper dividersCONS:- Costs more than paper dividers e.g. 11109","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery  Big Tab Insertable Plastic Dividers,  8-Tabs, 1 Set (11901)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ujpbds7XL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
