Occasionally I wondered aloud if I'd ever have another home cooked meal again.Then I discovered \"Microwave for One\" and everything changed.My favorite chapters were:Chapter 1: Plugging in your Microwave and YouChapter 4: How to Wait 3 MinutesChapter 11 [BONUS CHAPTER]: Eating with CatsIn closing, I give this book 2 thumbs up (and a paw!).
