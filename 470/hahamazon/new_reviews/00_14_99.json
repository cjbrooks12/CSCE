Those hopes were quickly crushed when using this item. First, a larger strawberry  will not fit in this slicer. If the strawberry has a soft spot the slice will turn to mush.Short of only buying the smaller organic strawberries, this slicer isn't big enough or I guess shrp enoungh to be effective. I kept this device for a week, using it many times. I really wanted it to make slicing faster and better. After a week I threw it in the bag for the Salvation Army. Just another gadget that doesn't deliver.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Simply Slice Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ejvDkkEBL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
