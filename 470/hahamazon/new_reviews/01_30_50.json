Also have an irresistible urge to hump the leg of anyone who comes over. Maybe washing it would help but I love the smell of it since I rolled on some road kill.  Must admit the bixxxhes love me when I have it on. Do they make matching boxers?","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"The Mountain Men's Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve T-Shirt","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JfNaBrblL._SX342_QL70_.jpg"}
