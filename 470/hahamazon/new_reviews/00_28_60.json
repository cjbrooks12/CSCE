Perfect banana slices every time. Every morning I slice a banana - six slices onto my cereal and six slices onto my husband's.  It takes seconds.  Just push the slicer over the banana and give it a quick squeeze. Another push, another squeeze and poof, that banana is history.My husband likes bananas but hates watching me do this for some reason.  He hasn't slept in weeks.  I thought it was because I was clumsy at first while I got the hang of it, but I'm real good at it now.  Push - squeeze, push - squeeze.  Real quick.  He still hates it.  Go figure.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Bananza Banana Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317K7iQcZXL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"}
