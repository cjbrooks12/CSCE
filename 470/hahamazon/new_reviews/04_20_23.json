I also love the EZD binder system since it keeps the papers at the back of the binder from getting squished.In case it's not clear from the photo, there is no clear pocket insert on the cover, so you can't slide a piece of paper into the front.Works well for the cost!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Blue (79882)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3144O4OzsuL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
