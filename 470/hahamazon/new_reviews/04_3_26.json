Having a nice binder takes that little bit of extra stress out of the day when class is starting.  These binders are heavy duty (so they don't fall apart midway through the semester), and the EZD ring makes it really easy to open the rings to add or remove paper.  I also like that the front and back have double sleeves on the inside so I can easily organize additional material.  The front and back covers are nice for making cover sheets too.I would highly recommend these.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy Duty 2 inch Black View Binder with One Touch EZDTM Ring","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-RDeZUMbL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
