I use this tray mostly for writing notes or using my bluetooth keyboard. I haven't used it for eating, but I'm sure it would fine. I gave it 4 stars because while this product is useful, the tray does not securely attach to the steering wheel. I'm not sure I would place my food or drink on this tray and trust the tray won't slip or detach from the steering wheel, creating a huge mess.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Multi-Functional Portable Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray - Gray Table/Car Vehicle Seat Portable Mount Tray Laptop Notebook Table Eating Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414V-KP4Q3L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
