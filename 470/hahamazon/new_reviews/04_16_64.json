It keeps me in my place, allows me to get dinner ready on time, AND only costs 72% of the more masculine version.  Some people might think it's sexist, but sheesh, I'm not binding my feet, just my brain.  Extra bonus, if you sit on it just right, it can act as an effective method of birth control!  Full disclosure:  I submitted this under my husband's account, with his full permission.  He is the head of our household, and the owner of the binder.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2 inch Rings, Green, 1 Binder (17838)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BgQIywr4L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
