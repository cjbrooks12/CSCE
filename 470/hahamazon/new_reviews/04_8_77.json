Anyways, these are normal good binders, I bought them for school so they are sufficing my needs. One thing I would reccoment though is to get binders of different colors, it's a slight problem when you're pulling them out of a backpack thus not letting you see the front of them, so it's hard to distinguish them. Overall its a good product and it was worth the 12$ I paid for them(the price went up guys, sorry!).","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Wilson Jones Round Ring View Binder, 1.5 Inch, Basic, 362 Series, Customizable, White, 4 Pack (W70362-34WPP)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pprQHFnPL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
