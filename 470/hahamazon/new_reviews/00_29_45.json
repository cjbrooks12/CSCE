Knowing how great the Hutzler banana slicer was at slicing bananas, I couldn't wait to try it as cereal. I grabbed a bowl, threw in a few Hutzler banana slicers, added milk, and grabbed my spoon in anticipation. Here is where the trouble began.Not only did the Hutzler banana slicer not taste good by any stretch of the imagination, but it also sliced my voice box into 18 evenly sized pieces on its way down. Now when I speak I sound like a crowd of people at a protest all chanting the same thing (although I now do a pretty killer impression of the Yip Yip aliens from Sesame Street). This is not convenient. I now have to try to make something positive out of this disaster and will be appearing on America's Got Talent as a one man male voice choir.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"2 Pack Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer 571b","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Fglyb6IwL._AC_UL160_SR141,160_.jpg"}
