Not exactly whole, I'd say!  Maybe it was just damaged during shipping, but I won't be buying another one.  I mean - without the long ears, how do I know it even WAS a rabbit?  It was the same size and shape as a cat...not that I've seen a cat with its head, fur and insides missing.  I mean, not like really close or anything.On the plus side, it was delicious with a tall, cold glass of Tuscan Milk, so I give it three stars.  That's three WHOLE stars, BTW.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Fresh Whole Rabbit","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XR4HKSXRL._QL70_.jpg"}
