If you get overripe fruit, you will end up mashing the fruit.  Tried using this for tomatoes, but I think you'll need a bigger huller.  Overall, another cool and good kitchen product.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412yjfCuJ5L._AC_UL160_SR95,160_.jpg"}
