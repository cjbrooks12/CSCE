The person hulling those berries was able to make quick work of it and did hardly any damage to the berry itself.I brought home almost 8 lbs of strawberries yesterday and nearly all of them hulled in 30 minutes!  And just the hulls and stems were taken out, the berries were absolutely unharmed.  Really great product!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n StemGem Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TL1TBYz1L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
