Certain more expensive models have an improved ring-locking mechanism which is less likely to catch on individual sheets of paper. That said, this binder should be OK as long as I don't add too many sheets of paper to it; I would say 100 should be the limit rather than the stated 175.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Economy View Binder with 2-Inch Round Ring, White, Pack Of 4 (19202)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BOlG5BbLL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
