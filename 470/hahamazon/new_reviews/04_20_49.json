The one I received has tissue-thin vinyl that's bunched and doesn't lie flat.  Avery used to produce quality products, but since being bought out (won't say by whom) their merchandise is ridiculously flimsy, cheap, and not worth a penny, much less what they're charging here.If anyone knows of a good brand, please respond.  I'm still using an American-made National brand binder that's fifteen years old and still in great condition.  In the last ten years I haven't been able to find any new binders that are usable for more than a year before the sides split.Cheers!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Blue (79882)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3144O4OzsuL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
