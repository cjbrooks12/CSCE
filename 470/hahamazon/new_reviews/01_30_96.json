{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008B5ISVO","name":"01_30_96","review":"Now, before I begin, I will note that I am a 450-pound unemployed man that lives in his mother's basement, with a daily lifestyle of eating Cheetos from the bag and watching reruns of Toddlers and Tiaras--at least, that's how my life WAS before I was introduced to this shirt.A friend of mine had given this shirt to me for my 23rd birthday last month, in a last-ditch effort to spur my motivation for life and get me off my arse. The size he gave me was an XL, and I need an XXXXL, so it was more of a tube top than a shirt (but that's beside the point). Anyway, I was waddling out of the house to make my hourly trip to the Walmart cafeteria when I was practically blinded by a flashing light. What the hellllll? When my eyes had been cleared, I looked up to notice several beautiful young women all fighting to \"get a picture with that sexy stud\" and I was so shocked that I fell onto the floor (and a nearby Walmart employee had to help me up, but that's beside the point, again). As I left Walmart, 'wolfing' down my Big Mac (heh heh, see what I did there?) I was approached by a sir in a black suit and he asked if I would model for a nude cologne shoot!!! I was shocked once more , agreed, and as I was leaving the parking lot to head on home I was passing a local Target and a swarm of girls surrounded my car and pulled me out (which is no easy task) and trampled me with kisses to the point in which I had to be hospitalized. (And I am now using the hospital computer to write this).I highly recommend this product.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"The Mountain Men's Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve T-Shirt","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JfNaBrblL._SX342_QL70_.jpg"}
