Before I was always trying to fit into the corporate world.  I wanted things like equal pay, safety from sexual harassment and the right to have health care coverage for birth control.  But after purchasing this binder I feel totally put in my place.  Now I know from the safety of my binder that men are much more capable of making these kinds of decisions for me.  I obviously do not deserve equal pay because I am always asking for special accommodations, like leaving early to make dinner for my children- which is in no way, under any circumstances, a man's responsibility.  Women are the one's who always cook dinner, every night.  Asking to leave early for this purpose is a fair reason to pay us less for the same exact work.  Also, sexual harassment I learned is actually just a man's way of showing his affection for me and reminding me of my weakness and inability to care for myself.  Finally, birth control is in no way a right.  Women are the vessels in which men plant their seed, from the safety of my binder I can be available for procreation at all times.  I am so grateful for my binder.  The world is such a simpler place from in here.  It also has the added bonus of helping me control my emotions and preventing me from making irrational decisions like voting.  5 stars, Amazon!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2 inch Rings, Green, 1 Binder (17838)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BgQIywr4L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
