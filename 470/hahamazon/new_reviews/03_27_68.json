Don't ask me how. The engineering team and scientists that brought you the Wheelmate steering wheel desk attachment, didn't give up after conquering their first hurdle. They did not sit on their hands, basking in the glory of their collective success.Granted, the new project took them eight long years of intensive field tests, but the resilience and perseverance of the human spirit overcame all obstacles in the end; again! and now we have the new and improved \"Extreme\" version of the wheel desk.Much has already been said and written about their original model. Lives were lost and many endure irreversible medical damages. But, let me not digrees and -instead- let's jump into the holiday spirit of the season and concentrate on the positive. The Wheelmate Extreme is bound to be a success: It's got a larger work surface made of anti-skid birch wood! This alone can be crucial to prevent objects such as babies, pieces of drug paraphernalia and even laptops and gaming PC's, to fly off when making a turn, whenever that imponderable moment makes an appearance.The new Wheelmate Extreme also comes endowed with a thicker format. So, when the unexpected arises, it can be used as a makeshift gurney while help works its way into the scene.It's the perfect gift for that special person we all have in our lives!UPDATE: 01/08/15Many may balk at the $30.00 price for a piece of... wood. But let's not lose sight of the nobility of the material and the minimal ecological impact of using sandwiched wood. I mean, the engineering cleverness of gluing sheets of wood together is a stroke of genius... It may come apart at strategic times, depending on the severity of the impact. These manufacturers have thought of everything!I'd give the wheel desk an extra star if I could, just on that alone. This product will make you see the stars!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"AutoExec WMEX-01 'Wheelmate Extreme' Vehicle Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qSXaxpUqL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
