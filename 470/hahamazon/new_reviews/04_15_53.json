At first, the rings stayed tightly closed and I was very pleased.  I also LOVE the lever for opening the rings. But, after just a short time, the rings, particularly the middle one as another reviewer mentioned, have started to gap and the pages catch on them.  To be fair, I do have the binder full so, perhaps, if you only used it at, say, half capacity, this might not happen.  I will probably wind up buying the same model in a 4 inch binder and hope that will work.  I do, as I've already mentioned, love the lever.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty View Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Rings, Pacific Blue, 1 Binder (79724)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xb0sZIYxL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
