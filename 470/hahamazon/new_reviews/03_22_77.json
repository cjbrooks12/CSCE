Not so great for eating on the fly though as my steering wheel has a central spoke on the bottom.  I can only attach it to the top of the steering wheel.  However, I don't think it was designed for use while the car is in motion so it might be unfair to ding it for that application.  All in all it does exactly what it was designed to do so no complaints here!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Ipad Laptop/Eating Steering Wheel Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gu166efrL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
