They're just the right size - 1\" and white as I'd wanted.  They're hard to open and to close, but I knew what I was getting, so this didn't surprise me at all.  They were purchased for a project for my students so that they could keep all the information about the project organized in one separate binder and it does just that without undue expense.  The girls are happy with them.  I'm happy with them and their value, so what else is there?","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Economy View Binder with 2-Inch Round Ring, White, Pack Of 4 (19202)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BOlG5BbLL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
