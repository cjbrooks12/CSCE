But, it just goes to show how you shouldn't pass judgment based on appearances, cuz the thing fits securely on her steering wheel (as if it came with it), and has literally changed my mother's life.I will say that my mother's work-issued laptop is definitely on the smaller side (roughly iPad-sized ), so i can't vouch for the tray's effectiveness with more standard-sized models, but for my mother's purposes, it's worked like a dream :-)","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Multi-Functional Portable Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray - Gray Table/Car Vehicle Seat Portable Mount Tray Laptop Notebook Table Eating Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414V-KP4Q3L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
