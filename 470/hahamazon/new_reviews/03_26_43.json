It's perfect for my phone to watch videos or a movie while I wait. I don't have to try to balance my phone on the steering wheel or dashboard anymore!!  It's not big enough for a laptop, but it's the perfect size for a tablet or phone.  I like the small-ish size as it fits perfectly in the car door's pocket which makes for easy storage.  I haven't used it for food, but it is the perfect size for a sandwich or a burger and fries/chips.  I wouldn't put a drink on this, mostly because I am clumsy and I know I'd knock it off.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Ipad Laptop/Eating Steering Wheel Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gu166efrL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
