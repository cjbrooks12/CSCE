There's 2 main problems.  First, I read the reviews saying it wasn't large enough, but I thought they were referring to those massive, gourmet strawberries that are the size of plums or small apples.  They weren't - this device is too small for many of the strawberries I get every week.  You have to cut them in half to fit, which results in ugly slivers that are hard to eat.  Second, the blades are not sharp at all.  This might be a safety or liability issue, but I wouldn't even call them blades so much as metal strips.  They don't do the cutting, your hand pressure does.  What this means is that you squeeze and squeeze, and when the pressure gets great enough the device pops and the strawberry is forced through the strips.  The strawberries get bruised and come out very wet from being squeezed.  This device requires enough pressure that I think someone with any sort of coordination or strength issue in their hands would not be able to use it.  What's disappointing is that the device seems like it would work well (small size aside) if decent blades were provided.  I'll use it until it breaks and then look for something different.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LXsBc0ERL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
