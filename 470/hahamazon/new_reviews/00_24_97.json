The blades are very dull.  The space for strawberries does not accommodate larger strawberries....thus, the only way to fit it in the groove is to slice it with a knife first...thereby defeating the purpose of the slicer.  You're better off just slicing with a knife and a cutting board.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Simply Slice Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ejvDkkEBL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
