I set her on the table across from me while I'm eating, she is always smiling at me listens to everything I say, never interrupting.  She keeps smiling at me even when I put on my tinfoil protection suit under my regular clothes.  My mom and dr just don't understand, but Sonia totally understand and supports me.I am confused though, because this morning my mom asked me why I was talking to a book.  Sonia handled that insult very graciously, she just kept that pleasant smile on her face, I don't know how she puts up with it!  I try to be like Sonia and be calm and smile, but my mom says I creep her out when I do that.Next, my mom accused me of not taking my pills, which are really little spy cams...Sonia and I both know this but my mom seems to be in denial.  I'm worried about my mom, I think she is going a little crazy and hallucinating.My mom said Sonia is really just a book about microwaving meals for one person...crazy talk.  Sonia totally knows microwaves are alien bodysnatching transporters and gives me guidance on how to protect me from it with tinfoil.  There is NO WAY Sonia would actually ever use one. And to cook food with?  Bazzario world!So worried about my mom.  She needs help.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Microwave for One"}
