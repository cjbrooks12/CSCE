This folder would have been great if it had a tab at the top as well as the bottom to keep the tension from top to bottom.  The problem with not having a tab at the top is there is no tension to keep the binder ring from opening .  Hence the papers slip through the top ring as you are flipping through pages and it's just one big hassle to deal with when you're trying to keep things organized and you end up with a different kind of mess.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Blue (79882)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3144O4OzsuL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
