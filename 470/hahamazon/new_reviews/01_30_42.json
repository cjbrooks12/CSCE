{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008B5ISVO","name":"01_30_42","review":"There I was, rockin' my new duds, when I needed to scratch my stomach.  Little did I know that the itch was merely the wolves getting my attention.  They needed to be fed.  Of course, being new to the shirt, I didn't realize what would happen next.  I lost three fingers (one to each wolf) when I scratched.  While it was painful, it was my fault for not feeding these majestic carnivores.  The great news is that, due to the magical restorative powers of the shirt, my fingers quickly grew back.Due the dangerous nature of the shirt, I do not allow my children to hug me when I wear this shirt.  Since I wear the shirt every single day of the week (even when showering), it is causing a minor amount of emotion trauma to my hug-starved children.  However, they understand the powers of the shirt, and know that it is not a shirt that simply goes in a closet.  They now respect the shirt and have taken to hugging my legs instead.Overall, a great purchase.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"The Mountain Men's Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve T-Shirt","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JfNaBrblL._SX342_QL70_.jpg"}
