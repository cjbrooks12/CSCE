Presumably one is expected to find women on one's own, or contact women's groups who are supposedly eager to help stock your empty binder with women.For a first time buyer like myself, I have to say I would rather have waited until I had accumulated a few women before investing in a binder. Just a little warning for prospective buyers.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2 inch Rings, Dark Blue, 1 Binder (17837)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BsQQn3gVL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
