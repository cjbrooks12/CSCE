They want a mini fortune just for 1 in stores. We are in a custody battle and I use these to separate the important info the lawyer/judge need to see. I was having to write the name/what it contained on a pc of paper and tape it to the front of our plain/reg binders. Now I can print off a better looking sheet to place in front. My daughter also uses these for high school classes. Since she cant doodle on anything else, she draws/writes on paper and places in the front which she loves.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Economy View Binder with 2-Inch Round Ring, White, Pack Of 4 (19202)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BOlG5BbLL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
