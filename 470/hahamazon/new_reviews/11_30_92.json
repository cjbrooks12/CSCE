Finally a version of Outlook that will run on my wooden Chinese toilet seats!!\"  Little did I know this has **NOTHING** to do with Outlook for Windows or any other MicroSoft product.  It is NOT a five-year wooden-toilet email/calendar software product, but is in fact some kind of WELL-DONE REPORT ON TOILET SEATS!!  By coincidence still entirely useful to me in my line of business but now I will have to find some other way to coordinate my inter-seat schedules and emails!! Buyer beware!!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"The 2009-2014 Outlook for Wood Toilet Seats in Greater China"}
