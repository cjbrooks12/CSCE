{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005MR3IVO","name":"15_30_67","review":"A little over a decade ago, I bought my 55 gallon drum of lube. I never thought I'd use it all but a few days ago the pump finally ran dry. I've had a lot of good times with it. My wife, too. And not just what you'd think. One day I just hosed down our hardwood-floored hallway so I could use it as a slip-n-slide. You shouldn't think of this as a 'purchase.' It's an 'investment.' An investment sure to pay off in spades.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Passion Lubes, Natural Water-Based Lubricant, 55 Gallon Drum","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KQvoSmMhL._SY300_QL70_.jpg"}
