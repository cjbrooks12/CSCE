This may work with coyotes, but it is less effective with huge ships.- Similarly, do not roll your boat over and play dead. Unless the huge ship is captained by a grizzly bear, this will not work.- Do not attempt to go under the huge ship. This is typically not successful.- Do not attempt to jump over the huge ship.Captain Trimmer presents a rather novel technique for avoiding huge ships - move your boat out of the path of the huge ship. I know what you're thinking, this goes against conventional wisdom, but Trimmer presents significant empirical evidence to support his theory. Indeed, over the long run, moving out of the way will dramatically decrease the number of huge ship collisions you will have to endure in your daily life.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"How to Avoid Huge Ships"}
