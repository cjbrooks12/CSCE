They keep sticking out over the edges, even getting away in some cases. I thought using clear, glass-ceiling page protectors would help, but it doesn't seem to slow them down anymore.I'm going to have to resort to more severe three-hole punching, to keep my women in line. And maybe switch to the Trap Her, Keep Her.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2 inch Rings, Green, 1 Binder (17838)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BgQIywr4L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
