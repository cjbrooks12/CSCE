I would purchase them, and put them into the fridge, where they would then get moldy and be thrown away.  It had gotten to the point where my husband told me I was no longer going to be \"allowed\" to buy strawberries (like that ever stopped me).  When I saw this, I had to give it a try.  I have 2 daughter that LOVE strawberries, and, yeah, I was lazy about doing it before.  My finger would get pruney and my girls would have them devoured before I even threw away the empty container.  I knew there had to be an easier, faster way to complete the act of washing, coring and slicing strawberries.  I mean, isn't necessity the mother of all inventions?  So, I figured I'd give this a try.  i LOVE it! I can put the strawberries into the colander while running water over it.  I usually core (or de-stem, or \"cut the green off\") all at one time, then slice the strawberries SO fast!  I can do a container in about 7-10 minutes.  I know this because suddenly the bus will be on the way, and I remember I was supposed to cut strawberries.  They make very thin slices, and the entire process is very fast!  I am now, once again \"allowed\" to buy strawberries.
