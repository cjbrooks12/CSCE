I cut up a lot of strawberries, here in NOLA we get our strawberries from Northern Louisiana in Feb and then again in fall. I can't buy enough, I freeze them, make strawberry shortcakes, chocolate dipped strawberries, strawberry jams. One day I saw a show on TV and it was showing an Artisan jam maker and she was using the huller, the ease with which she was hulling, and the relatively unbutchered strawberry left convinced me I needed one. And am I glad I bought this! It's sturdy, the serrated teeth and round scoop easily hull strawberry after strawberry and the handle is comfortable so I can sit at the table, put on some bluegrass, and hull away without my hand cramping or feeling tired. if you, like me, thought this was silly and a knife would do a good enough job, do yourself a favor and give the huller a try. It's wonderful","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie Stainless Steel Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412yjfCuJ5L._AC_UL160_SR95,160_.jpg"}
