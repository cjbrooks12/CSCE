Apparently Denon forgot how accustomed most of us are to unidirectional time and the general laws of physics.  I tried to get used to this effect but hearing songs play before I even realized I was in the mood for them just really screwed up my preconceptions of choice and free will.  I'm still having a major existential hangover.Would not purchase again.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VDnWJV9BL._SX300_QL70_.jpg"}
