Well after having had it for a little while,  there are a few things I have learned:  1.  Don't unleash this beast around other photographers or anyone else for that matter unless you are a total camera snob and are trying to compensate for certain inadequacies.  2.  Use a monster tripod - this beast weighs over 100 lbs.. 3.  Let the lens come to ambient temperature before using.  4.  Do not use it for photographing ANYTHING from the deck of your home in San Francisco - unless you want your neighbors phoning SFPD complaining that you are a voyeur - SFPD was impressed with my photos of the Palace of Fine Arts and Alcatraz. Now I wanted this lens for nature photography - this is what I do for fun.  Unfortunately, I think the lens is much too large and heavy to be transported with any ease other than hiring a Sherpa.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Sigma 200-500mm f/2.8 APO EX DG Ultra-Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uAOqLVCOL._SY300_QL70_.jpg"}
