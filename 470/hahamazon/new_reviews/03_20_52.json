I work in home health and am in my car a lot of the day.  I drive to various appointments throughout day and in between  I am in my car doing documentation on my laptop.  I use this for both holding the laptop and as a tray to hold lunch when eating on the go. For some people this might seem gimmicky, but ive found its actually something I use quite frequently and it does make things a bit easier especially for someone who spends a lot of time in their car.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray (Black)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51prtxcwKtL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
