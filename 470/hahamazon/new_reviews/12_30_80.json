Meera and Osha made it look so simple. But both Brad and I pulling together couldn't get that damn skin off. The rabbit wound up looking more like Theon Greyjoy's finger than a rabbit.Second, apparently you cannot light an open fire in your backyard in Los Angeles. No one told us that. Thanks, LAFD, for understanding.Third, it pretty much tastes like chicken.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Fresh Whole Rabbit","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21XR4HKSXRL._QL70_.jpg"}
