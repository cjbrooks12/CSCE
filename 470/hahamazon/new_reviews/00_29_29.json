What if i hit one of the new Australian or Ugandan GMO bananas and (shudder) RUIN IT! OMG.Then when i opened the box and looked, i had to realize I'D HAD NO CLUE HOW FAT THOSE SLICES WERE! Yes! when slicing my bananas and seldom fingers to put on the drying racks i use for my various fruit drying - i sliced them about half as thick as the Hutzler, but I HAD BEEN WRONG!Thank you again Hutzler! i sliced up my organic bananas - an entire bundle - very quickly and evenly and was amazed to  find that the entire bundle fits into my decorative, quart sized jars next to the figs, raisins, craisins, dried apples, pears, peaches, gojis and about 6 more. ONE BUNCH IN LESS THAN A QUART JAR!!!If that weren't wonderful enough (thanks, banana engineers for straightening me out on slice measurements!) in this winter season when i have to use my electric dehydrators - the fatter slices peel easier, and since there are less of them they peel easier and faster on two levels.For those wondering how i know it is the organic model - the organic bananas sliced MUCH better, the non organic split much more. *sighs* i will survive.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"2 Pack Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer 571b","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Fglyb6IwL._AC_UL160_SR141,160_.jpg"}
