It attaches onto the bottom of your steering wheel and the pressure of your items holds it in place. One side of the tray has an indentation to hold  a cup and keep it from sliding off the tray and the other side is smooth for either a laptop or tablet, or to use as a writing surface and has a pen or pencil holder. It doesn't look like it would hold a laptop, but it does. Easy to get onto the steering wheel and easy to get off. A great product for home health/hospice nurses or others who work out of their car. I use it to do my charting in my car and not have to sit in my patient's homes and do it. I use it 5 days a week and wonder how I have lived without it.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray (Black)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51prtxcwKtL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
