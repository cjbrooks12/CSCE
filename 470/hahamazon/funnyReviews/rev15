6 years ago, I was a homeless man living on the streets of Manhattan. But then my life changed forever, a kind stranger approached me, holding something behind his back. Then, without saying a word, placed a beautiful artifact in front of me. Tuscan milk. Needless to say I was confused but I accepted the gift. Less than a day later, the bridge I was sleeping under collapsed, trapping me. For the next 7 days I had nothing to drink save this milk. Without it, I would have died. I saw this milk as a sign of God and decided to change some things. Eventually I got a job working as a fry cook at a small resturuant chain and got the courage to face my family again. My father and I began to work together and I got an idea for a business. My father, being a well off man, proceeded to give me a small loan of a million dollars. Using that money, I established multiple hotels across the country, started my own family, and even starred on my own tv show. Now I have a larger goal, to become president of the United States of America. My name is Donald J Trump, and this milk has allowed me to stump the negativity out of my life, and it is all because of...Tuscan...milk...
