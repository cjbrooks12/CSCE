I shrugged, not willing to write this binder off yet. But now, after only a couple of uses, I'm noticing another spot that's also cracked. The material does not flex, so it cracks easily. If it wasn't for the poor quality of the covering, I would rate this 5 stars based on the \"one touch\" mechanism of the metal rings and its quality. Disappointed that more care wasn't taken to give this \"heavy-duty\" binder true durability.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Blue (79882)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3144O4OzsuL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
