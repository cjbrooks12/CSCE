I'm very happy with my purchase and here's why:1.  Sturdiness- they hold up well.  What I give out to my clients is a reflection of my brand and I don't have to worry about the quality of the binder.  The spine holds up well and the binders feel nice- not flimsy and cheap.2.  Size- they are perfect size for the handouts.  They easily hold about 250 pages of material with tabs.3.  Ease of Use- the rings open and shut easily when I want to open them yet stay closed nice and tight when they should. I don't worry about losing pages or something because the binder popped open.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Wilson Jones Round Ring View Binder, 1.5 Inch, Basic, 362 Series, Customizable, White, 4 Pack (W70362-34WPP)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pprQHFnPL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
