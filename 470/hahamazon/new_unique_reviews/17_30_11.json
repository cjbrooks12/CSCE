Saw a nesting and pointed the lens, soon as it came into focus the poor thing dropped dead from the suns reflection off the lens.  So I headed off to a shelter.  I saw a beatiful wood duck framed the image in the viewfinder.  I tell you what, I was not ready for the recoil when I hit the shutter release.  The whole thing rocked on the tripod and gave me a black eye.  The duck was gone, nothing but feathers on the water. I checked the image on the canon, captured  it beautifully just before the duck exploded.  Cant wait for deer season, hope to catch some bucks fighting and use the antlers to make the frame.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Sigma 200-500mm f/2.8 APO EX DG Ultra-Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon DSLR Cameras","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uAOqLVCOL._SY300_QL70_.jpg"}
