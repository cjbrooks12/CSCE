I was talking to my food delivery guy, Ping, about what he thought was the biggest obstacle to market expansion in his native China. He said to me, very enigmatically, one word: \"Sprinters\". I can't for the life of me figure out what influence people who run track could have. Especially just short distances. Next time I order Moo Goo Guy Pan I'll see if he can explain further.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"The 2009-2014 Outlook for Wood Toilet Seats in Greater China"}
