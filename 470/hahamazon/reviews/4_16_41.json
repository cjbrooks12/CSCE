If you're using these for school reasons, they're MOST LIKELY going to break by the end of the year. The cardboard material they use isn't very sturdy and ultimately tends to break/decay by the end of the year.However, during the year, the binders never failed me (except sometimes when the ring doesn't close evenly)This is also a very great price for a decent product. Recommend.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2 inch Slant Rings, White, Pack of 4 (17577)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31gfBa5tIGL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
