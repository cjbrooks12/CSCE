{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008B5ISVO","name":"1_20_79","review":"Upon recieving this shirt and putting it on I noticed that it was several sizes too big for me. I kept it on overnight and upon waking up the next morning it had become a much better fit. After a couple more days of wear it's now become so tight that any lesser shirt would burst into shreds (not to mention the mortal inside) The thing is that the shirt hasn't shrunk at all but the it has grown me to, what I believe is, the level that it requires me to be at. My doctor says that trying to remove it at this point could severely endanger my life (I don't think he even realizes how true that is) but I don't know why I would possibly want it removed in the first place4 stars because the design, color, and quality are pretty poor. Everything else is perfect though","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"The Mountain Men's Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JfNaBrblL._SX342_QL70_.jpg"}
