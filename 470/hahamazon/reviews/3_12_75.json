Would definitely recommend this tray! This is a great item if you do a lot of driving and eat in the car; I have a dog, so I don't go into restaurants. It's nice to have a \"table\" to eat at.  However, I would not set a drink on this as I would worry it would knock over. Besides, that's what cup holders are for anyway.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray (Black)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51prtxcwKtL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
