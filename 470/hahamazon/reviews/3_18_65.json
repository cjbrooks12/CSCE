I have an hour break in between my two jobs. I pack meals and snacks, and when my car is parked in the parking lot, I have somethings to eat.  For years I have been frustrated with how awkward it can be to eat in my car without a proper table. I would drop food in my lap!  Now that I have this table it makes that hour break so much more enjoyable. I can set my cell phone on it and check email as I have a bite to eat! It feels like luxury after all this years of roughing it.  This product was well worth my $18!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray (gray)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ye6Mb9MCL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
