I mostly use it for melons.  Don't use massive force or shoot all of your weight on it all at once and you'll be fine.  Take your time and use even force.  Cuts easily.  It is very sharp, so just keep that in mind when using and you won't hurt yourself.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Home Basics Melon Slicer with Rubber Grip Handles","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413rzVGdIQL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
