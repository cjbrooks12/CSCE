This desk does the job; it holds a fairly heavy Dell Tablet; doesn't move at all while I type.  I do have to slide my seat back, but I'm okay with that.  My co-workers type sideways but that's so uncomfortable.  Yes, I would recommend this desk; for the price it works very well and I'm satisfied.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray (gray)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ye6Mb9MCL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
