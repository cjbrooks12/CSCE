It is easier to clean, makes far neater slices, and doesn't seem to waste as much banana as the Husqvarna 460 does, all at a considerably lower price. I would definitely recommend this for all your banana-related needs.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Bananza Banana Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317K7iQcZXL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"}
