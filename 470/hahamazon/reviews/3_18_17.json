I ordered this for our car and it has been invaluable ever since.  The table is lightweight, yet very sturdy.  My husband LOVES not having to balance a meal upon his legs.  It even has a little spot made for a drink cup.  I have used it while waiting at a doctor office to do my crossword puzzles on.  It slips right on the wheel and is very stable.  When not in use, just slip it behind or under the seat. I just wish there was a steering wheel on the passenger side of the car so that we could use two at mealtime on the road!!!!  Both sides have a \"well\" in it - I like this feature, if you spill a bit it does not go on your lap or car seat.  The other side also has a narrow groove with a built in \"clip\" that holds a pen quite nicely. We are so pleased with this product that my mother, sister, adult nieces and nephews will all be getting one this Christmas.  Very well made and nice price too!!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Laptop and Food Steering Wheel Tray (gray)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ye6Mb9MCL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
