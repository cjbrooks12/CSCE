It really is easy open with one touch on the bottom, and it seems heavy duty as advertised although it's hard to know how long it will last without the benefit of a LOT of time.  The front and spine all allow for a slip-in presentation sheet; the back does not.  The back, in fact has a problem with that plastic covering: it is only adhered to the top edge of the binder for a few inches, which means that the gap can snag on something and the plastic can rip at the point where it is adhered to the top.  I have had the binder for only a few weeks and I can already see the beginnings of a rip at that point.  It almost seems as though that edge was improperly heat-sealed together.My other issue with the binder is at the spine.  Some binders include a clear plastic guide so that the label can be easily inserted into the spine section.  This binder does not, which makes for a more difficult job unless the spine label is rather stiff.Not bad, but I can't honestly say it's the be-all and end-all of binders.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty View Binder with 2 Inch  One Touch EZD Ring, White, 1 Binder (79792)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31AY%2BQcC2qL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
