I loved those pocket dividers because the tabs extend past the edges of my page protectors, so I can easily flip through my binder, finding the section I need. I wanted a set without the pockets to organize a binder for a class I'm taking. Unfortunately, despite having an almost identical name, this is a very different product.It's a nice, sturdy set of dividers with large, colorful, plastic tabs that you can label, keeping your binder organized. However, if your binder has page protectors in it, these dividers will NOT stick out past the edge. You can't see them at all, which renders them useless. Some of the other reviews said the tabs do stick out past page protectors, while some reviews said they didn't. They were cheap enough that I was willing to take the chance and see for myself. Well, there's a reason I don't usually gamble. . . . I lost, and now I'm stuck with yet another set of dividers that I can't use.If anyone knows of a set of non-pocketed dividers whose tabs extend past the edges of page protectors, please comment to let me know! I need them for several different binders, but I have yet to find any, and I can't keep randomly buying dividers, hoping one will work.If you don't need the tabs to stick out past the edges of your page protectors, then these dividers might be okay for you. I'll give them two stars, just because they might be useful for someone else. But for me, they're worthless.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery  Big Tab Insertable Plastic Dividers,  8-Tabs, 1 Set (11901)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ujpbds7XL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
