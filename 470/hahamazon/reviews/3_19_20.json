Often I find myself in my truck with the A/C on trying to fill out work orders, looking up parts, thumbing through a manual etc. I am driving a 2016 Ford Transit T150 and this fits very well. I am over 6 feet tall and 175 lbs so I am very slender and there is a sizeable 6-8 inch gap between me and the steering wheel desk so most guys will have \"room to grow\" so to speak.See my attached picture of how it fits with my laptop.Edit: Added photo with Crockpot lunch warmer to display how it sets up for lunch.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Cutequeen Trading car 1pcs Eating/Laptop Steering Wheel Desk Black(pack of 1)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KM9zL8vzL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
