I did have to put some Velcro on my keyboard to keep it from sliding off. I would recommend the use of Velcro or adhering rubber to the steering wheel device (That is the only reason I gave it a 4* instead of 5*). I have recommended this tray to other Officer's due to it being small enough to fit between the Duty Belt and Steering wheel and easy to store in gear bag.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Ipad Laptop/Eating Steering Wheel Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gu166efrL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
