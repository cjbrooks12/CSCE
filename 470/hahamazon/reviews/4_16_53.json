I was surprised at the size - they're not the same as most other binders (square, not the normal oblong.) If they'll be put on a shelf with other binders and you want a flush facing, look at other products. I didn't notice this when ordering, ,but they'll still be ok for our use.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2 inch Slant Rings, White, Pack of 4 (17577)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31gfBa5tIGL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
