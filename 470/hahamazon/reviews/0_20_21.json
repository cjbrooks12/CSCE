My husband and I would argue constantly over who had to cut the day's banana slices. It's one of those chores NO ONE wants to do! You know, the old \"I spent the entire day rearing OUR children, maybe YOU can pitch in a little and cut these bananas?\" and of course, \"You think I have the energy to slave over your damn bananas? I worked a 12 hour shift just to come home to THIS?!\" These are the things that can destroy an entire relationship. It got to the point where our children could sense the tension. The minute I heard our 6-year-old girl in her bedroom, re-enacting our daily banana fight with her Barbie dolls, I knew we had to make a change. That's when I found the 571B Banana Slicer. Our marriage has never been healthier, AND we've even incorporated it into our lovemaking.
