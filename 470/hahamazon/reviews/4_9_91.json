If you just need it to hold papers and live on a shelf most of its life, I think it will be fine.It has 3 nice pockets on the inside front and back cover.  I thought this was a pleasant and unexpected detail.Edit - I just came back to buy more binders. looks like the price jumped from $3.88 to about $10.  $4 or $5 is about right for the construction.  At $10, I'm going to look for something else.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Blue (79882)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3144O4OzsuL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
