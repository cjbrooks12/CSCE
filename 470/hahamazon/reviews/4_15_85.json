It's huge. The pockets, D-rings, and opening mechanism are all top quality.When measuring how much space you'll need for this binder in your bookshelf, backpack, etc., remember that the rings themselves are four inches, so the binder is even wider, close to five inches. The side of the binder with the rings will non-negotiably need that much room.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch Navy Blue Binder (79802)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412LwPNKtPL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
