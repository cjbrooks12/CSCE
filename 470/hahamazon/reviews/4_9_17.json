While that may not sound long to many people, it actually wasn't bad for him as some have fallen apart within a month.  Overall, this is a decent binder, but did give 4 stars because the rings inside seemed to be the first thing to go and could have been a little sturdier to begin with. I would recommend this product.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Ring, Blue (79882)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3144O4OzsuL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
