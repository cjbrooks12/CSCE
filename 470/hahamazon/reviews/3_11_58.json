I cant tell you how many times I've had to buy a new laptop because some pedestrian jumped in front of my car while I was reading Facebook and finding out why folks can't resist the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Finally, someone has invented a product to help those of us addicted to morning Facebook and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The plastic is heavy duty and easy to clean, while the convenient pencil holder is a great place for my spoon (I use it with my Cinnamon Toast Crunch) its very sturdy and fits the steering wheel perfectly I shouldâ€™ve find this earlier then it would make my life so much easier.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Ipad Laptop/Eating Steering Wheel Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gu166efrL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
