Most people are pleased with the concept that now you can slice two bananas instead of just one.  However, that's not the situation at all.  In reality, one is a \"right curve\" banana slicer and the other is a \"left curve\" banana slicer.I'm sure the confusion comes from the photo, in which they show the left curve slicer facing the wrong direction.  However if one closely reads the 57-page instruction manual, it makes it very clear that one of the set is for slicing bananas that curve to the left.In addition there is another unadvertised-yet-useful function.  If you happen to have a banana that has been removed from the bunch and is now turned upside-down... this device easily flips over so that you can slice upside-down bananas as well.  This makes it well worth the value!The price here on Amazon is amazing as well.  I have seen this exact same item sell for $19.95 (plus shipping and handling of only $49.95) on late night TV shows.  I even found one listing here on Amazon where it was selling for $835.99!  So this is an excellent bargain.Do be aware that while it's not available on Amazon, the home website for this merchant also offers a set of these in green (for those bananas that aren't quiet yet ripe) as well as brown-spotted for pre-slicing over-ripe bananas just prior to mashing them to a pulp with the Hutzler 572 BananaMasher.Be sure to check out  the Hutzler 570 Banana Peeler as well.  It really saves time on those stubborn stems.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"2 Pack Hutzler 571 Banana Slicer 571b","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Fglyb6IwL._AC_UL160_SR141,160_.jpg"}
