After reading the reviews, I figured I had found a great slicer. My Pampered Chef slicer broke after 10 years of usage...and being \"I want one now\" I hopped on Amazon to find a replacement.The colander is cute, and the huller is great. Those are the items that would get a higher rating. The slicer:*the strawberry shape is cute, but it interferes with usage*the 'slicers' are sturdy. but it's thickness does cause for a lot of squished strawberry. So, a little wasteful and messy.The BIGGEST drawback is that if you have big strawberries this slicer is very difficult to use. You either have to cut the strawberry to fit the slicer or stand the strawberry straight up and hold it there while pushing the slicer down.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie 3-Piece Strawberry Colander, Huller and Slicer Set","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YigJg%2BNUL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
