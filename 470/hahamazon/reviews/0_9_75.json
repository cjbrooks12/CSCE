The small strawberry shaped colander holds the  berries and you can wash them in advance of the prep work.  It will hold about 2 to 3 quarts of strawberries.  The small hulling tool is just the right size to cleanly remove the strawberry hull.  It is shaped like a small melon baller and it is efficient and will not bruise the berries.  The best is the strawberry slicer.  I have seen other slicers meant to do this job and they can cut fingers if you are not careful.  This quickly, cleanly and safely slices the berries.  Great for prepping strawberries for whatever recipe calls for sliced strawberries.  The slicer can also be used to slice mushrooms so there is some versatility in this tool.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Joie 3-Piece Strawberry Colander, Huller and Slicer Set","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YigJg%2BNUL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
