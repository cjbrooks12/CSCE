It is easy to use, solid and durable. I especially like the D ring feature as it makes it so much easier inserting documents.  I use this binder for my current year's condo business papers. The clear plastic spine sleeve and front sleeve make it so easy to label and find what year I'm working with.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch Navy Blue Binder (79802)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412LwPNKtPL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
