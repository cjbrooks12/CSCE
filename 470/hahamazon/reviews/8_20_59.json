{"url":"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003G4IM4S","name":"8_20_59","review":"I wanted one of these masks because of all the hype they have on the internet and just for the sheer creepiness factor. I purchased one from seller \"maskwholesaler\" since they were a few cents cheaper and they still shipped Prime. I regret being so cheap...Well they quickly shipped me, what i soon came to realize was a knock off version of the Accoutrements Horse Head Mask, leaving me to assume they were thinking I would not know the difference. I don't have a big head, but their mask was much too small to fit my average size head. When i put it on, the top of the mask would be stretched tight on the crown of my head but the bottom of the mask would not even go half way down my chin. Needless to say, seeing picture of people wearing them (being able to tuck the neck into shirts etc) and that it did not have the \"Accoutrements\" tag I suspected foul play.I then purchased one fulfilled by Amazon to compare the two. maskwholesaler's is noticeably much smaller, lower quality paint job and smelled horribly of paint and plastic!Needless to say, I am returning the mask and keeping the Amazon fulfilled real one, I couldn't be happier with it. I love creeping out my girlfriend with it :)I read a few reviews that echoed my concerns, so I don't think I'm the only one out there that is victim of these imitations. Don't be fooled! If it doesn't have the red \"Accoutrements\" tag, its probably fake.I took some pictures of the two side by side and I hope to upload them so everyone on here can see the difference.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Accoutrements Horse Head Mask","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NhtW9exnL._SX300_QL70_.jpg"}
