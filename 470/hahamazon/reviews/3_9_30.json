I can't find that table anywhere now. So, I took a chance and ordered this one. Well, I was very disappointed. Sorry to say. It's tiny and I won't use it. The only reason I ordered it was due to the fact that mine was olde and I broke one side that holds it up. It still works fine though. I'll just Crazy Glue, or Gorilla Glue it back together. They even sell spray paint for plastic material. I'll just wait for a better product to come along.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Car Auto laptop Tablet PC iPad Mount Stand Holder Desk Table Drink Food Cup Tray","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aCmnWA56L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
