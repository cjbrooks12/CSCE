I was able to put three grams of cat litter into the tank and drive forever.What's more, the atmosphere inside my home became 93% oxygen and virtually no carbon dioxide. In fact, I now exhale oxygen.One heck of a cable.Didn't notice any improvement in audio quality though.The $800 Apple iCable is clearly superior.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VDnWJV9BL._SX300_QL70_.jpg"}
