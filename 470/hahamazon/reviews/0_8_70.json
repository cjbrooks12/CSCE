I was hopeful that I would be able be able to cut through a large melon as shown. On the counter I had some difficulty, once I put it in the kitchen sink I had better leverage more ease and SUCCESS!  I was thrilled with the end result! I have now decided to also use it for summer gatherings with family and friends as it makes a lovely presentation for cook outs! The slices are a nice size, not too big and not too skimpy. I highly recommend this product!****** PLEASE NOTE I have to update this as I am so disappointed . this only lasted through 7 melons being sliced and then the plastic edges cracked and broke. It seemed to be of good quality but should have lasted beyond the summer.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Home Basics Melon Slicer with Rubber Grip Handles","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413rzVGdIQL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
