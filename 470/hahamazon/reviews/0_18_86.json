It not only cuts bananas, but also plantains, zuchinni, cucumbers, string beans, fingers (oops), and if you use your imagination, much more! In fact, I think I saw a rabbi with one of these in his bag.....simply amazing!!! With that in mind, I am thinking of starting a side business.....but back to food prep.The Chef'n Bananza has really simplified my life. As someone with OCD, I can now eat a banana that is sliced perfectly. I can't tell you how many bananas have gone to waste because they were 1mm thicker than another. I'm also not late for work anymore!!! It's not easy stacking banana slices in perfectly even slices after counting out exactly 925 flakes of cereal. Then getting my salad ready for my lunch....I used to spend HOURS prepping!!! Now I can do it in 2775 seconds. And since everything, including this review needs to be a factor of 185, life is now sooo much better! Thank you, Chef'n Bananza Banana Slicer!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Bananza Banana Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317K7iQcZXL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"}
