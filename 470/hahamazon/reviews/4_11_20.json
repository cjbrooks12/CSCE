So when I need the right choice, I turn to the presidential candidate that KNOWS.  One with prideful experience in this department.  I don't want to be filed away in an inferior & confusing electronic doohickey that I couldn't possibly understand. Or heaven forbid, have a man ask for & listen to my ideas!  I'd much rather rely on this top of the line, 1980s style, Avery Durable binder.  It's the choice America can trust.  My education, my ideas, my opinions, my choices, please PLEASE keep them safely stored away here and far away from the men that might fear them (I mean, want to use them to hire me somedaynever).  I'd write more about this most useful product, but it's time I hurry home to make dinner.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Durable View Binder with 2-Inch Slant Ring, Holds 8.5 x 11-Inch Paper, White, 1 Binder (17032)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51662g3SyQL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
