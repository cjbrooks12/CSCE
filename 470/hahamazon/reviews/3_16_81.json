A large laptop may be an comfortable fit, though I'm sure the size of the vehicle (and the driver... I'm no small guy!) would have to be the deciding factor. Plus, heavier laptops might not be supported by the light frame of this plastic table.Pros next: Simple. In our Ford Freestar, this fits comfortably on the wheel without crowding me. I use a Lenovo Miix 2 hybrid tablet PC with cellular data, 11\" version, and with the keyboard module attached it makes it quite easy to have the PC set up as a mobile weather station; as we are in the Midwest, tornado alley, spotting for severe weather, it is critical that we can get live radar data for our safety, and this simple \"table\" makes it much more convenient. With the keyboard removed, the tablet is usable in a more difficult fashion, but this frees up the additional space for note taking (yes, I still do use paper sometimes!) without having to direct attention away from the screen. And to put it away when the weather is done with us, it stows neatly in the pouches on the back of the front seats in our van.Again, if you have a 15\"-17\" laptop, this may not be the solution for you. But with the popularity of small lightweight PCs and mobile devices (iPad, Google Nexus Tablets, etc.) a simple table like this is all you need.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Zone Tech Car Ipad Laptop/Eating Steering Wheel Desk","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51gu166efrL._AC_UL160_SR159,160_.jpg"}
