Love wearing it but find myself lifting my leg when I go to the bathroom. Also have an irresistible urge to hump the leg of anyone who comes over. Maybe washing it would help but I love the smell of it since I rolled on some road kill.  Must admit the bixxxhes love me when I have it on. Do they make matching boxers?","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"The Mountain Men's Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51tuG5qIogL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
