And the description as \"Heavy-Duty\" sounded good.But I soon realized that in the binder I received the three rings, especially the middle one, did not close completely.  So each time I would move the pages to one side or other other they would catch on the slightly open rings. Sometimes this meant that the middle hole of several of the turned pages would pop out of the ring. All in all an unusable product.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery Heavy-Duty View Binder with 2-Inch One Touch EZD Rings, Pink, 1 Binder (79723)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SBvO9vn8L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
