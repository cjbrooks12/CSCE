Fantastic idea for anyone who does a lot of traveling.  This allows me to write on a flat surface and eat in my vehicle comfortably.  On my particular vehicle, the steering wheel needs to be turned sideways in order for this tray to securely mount to the wheel, but it still is perfectly functional and surprising strong.  It also feels like a solid piece of plastic to support a decent amount of weight, but light enough to easily carry.  When I am not using it, I can easily and quickly stow it between my center console and passenger seat, readily accessible for the next time I need it.  If you do a lot of traveling or simply want a comfortable place to eat in your vehicle this is definitely something worth getting.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Cutequeen Trading car 1pcs Eating/Laptop Steering Wheel Desk Black(pack of 1)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KM9zL8vzL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
