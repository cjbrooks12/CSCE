I contemplated getting a pit bull but my landlord doesn't allow them and pepper spray can spray back in your face. I wear this \"banana\" slicer on a chain around my neck and any time a creeper comes near me I flash them my banana slicer and they avert their eyes and go back to digging through the garbage. I haven't had the opportunity to slice any manfruit yet but I live in bath salts Florida and I have full faith that my banana slicer WILL do the job! Another safety bonus is that it is yellow and very reflective at night.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Bananza Banana Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317K7iQcZXL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"}
