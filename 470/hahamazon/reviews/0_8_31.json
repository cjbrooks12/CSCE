Works well if you read the directions.  It is important to cut off the top and bottom 1/2 inch of the melon so that the blades can get a good grip.  Sometimes you need to rock it back and forth a little to keep it moving through parts of the melon.  Some people indicated that they put their melons in the sink so that they could get downward pressure.  We found that if you cut a larger watermelon into 1/3rds it makes it much easier to get the blades through, requires less effort, and its also about the right amount for an average family to eat in one sitting.  We like the plastic fitted base as it helps contain the juices and doubles as a serving plate.  My parents are happy with the product.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Home Basics Melon Slicer with Rubber Grip Handles","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413rzVGdIQL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
