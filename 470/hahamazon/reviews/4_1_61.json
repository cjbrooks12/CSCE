There are sturdier ones with stronger front and back covers such as the Avery binders you find at your local stores, but you can't go wrong with this binder because it gets the job done.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Wilson Jones Heavy Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 2 Inch, Customizable, Light Blue (W363-44-2925)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51d4QpDY57L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
