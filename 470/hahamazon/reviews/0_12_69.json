I use it at least twice a week.  It works fabulous on strawberries but I use it most on mushrooms.  Tip:  It looks like you would hold the tool so that the food to be sliced goes into the top of the chamber but I found it works best if you turn it over and put the food in from the bottom (I hope this makes sense).  Anyway, I love this tool and highly recommend it!  And, of course, I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LXsBc0ERL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
