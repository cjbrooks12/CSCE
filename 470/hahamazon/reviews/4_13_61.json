I didn't want paper dividers because they would rip too easily. I needed them to be plastic so that I wouldn't have to worry about that. When I got them, I thought, nice!! 8 multi colored plastic dividers. I put them in along with my baseball page protectors to put the coupons in (for easier organization and easy finding). But I realized that the dividers are a little short next to the baseball protectors. Not much, just a little shorter than what I was hoping for. I really wanted the tabs to stick out just a little more than they do. But it's fine, I can still see most of the tab, the plastic is very sturdy and I can easily switch between departments without any issues or worries about the dividers ripping or tearing. I've had them now for over one month with some heavy duty flipping between pages and so far, so good. I'm very happy with them.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Avery  Big Tab Insertable Plastic Dividers,  8-Tabs, 1 Set (11901)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ujpbds7XL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
