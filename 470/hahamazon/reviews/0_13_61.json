Unfortunately, it works too well.First, I removed the stems from the strawberries at the breakfast table. All well and good.Then, I went into the fridge and removed the stems from the strawberries there. Excessive, my wife says.So I went to the local supermarket and removed the stems from several boxes of strawberries. The manager told me to stop. But he didn't say anything about the tomatoes, which I began to de-stem. The police office was much less friendly than I expected, but at least he didn't arrest me.When I got back home, I started planting tomatoes. When my yard was full I started planting tomatoes in the neighbor's yard. The police officer was even less friendly, but he was kindly compared to the warden.At least they let me remove the stems from the tomatoes in the prison kitchen, and with good behavior, I should be paroled in a couple of months.So if you buy one of these, be careful not to get too excited.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n StemGem Strawberry Huller","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TL1TBYz1L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
