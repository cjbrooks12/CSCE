She has loved using it to slice bananas to put in her cereal each morning.  However the other night I found an alternative use.  I have teenage daughters.  One of them is always dating boys from the wrong side of the tracks.  New Years Eve she brought home her latest flavor of the month.  Usually I try to chat with these gentleman about their intentions towards my daughter.  Typically occupy my hands by cleaning my vast array of assault rifles while i chat with the fellow.  However this night i was fresh out of gun oil.  Always the one to improvise, I grabbed a pack of Oscar Meyer Hot Dogs and the banana slicer.  I proceeded to discuss my fatherly love for my daughter while slicing the hot dogs into mico thin slices.Not only did this young man bring my daughter home by 9 pm New Years Eve, i am told he has now moved to another city.Thanks Chef'n Bananza!!!!","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Bananza Banana Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317K7iQcZXL._AC_UL160_SR107,160_.jpg"}
