Please check that before mentioning it in your reviews.I was disappointed.  I consider myself an audiophile - I regularly spend over $1000 on cables to get the ultimate sound.  I keep my music-listening room in a Faraday cage to prevent any interference that could alter my music-listening experience.  Sending any signal down ordinary copper can degrade the signal considerably.  While ordinary listeners might not notice, to somebody with even a rudimentary knowledge of sound, the artifacts are glaring.  Denon should have used silver wiring (hermetically sealed inside the rubber sheath to prevent any tarnishing, of course), which has a significantly higher conductivity than copper.  Furthermore, Denon needs to treat the wires they use in the cable with a polarity inductor to ensure minimal phase variance.Needless to say, I returned the cable and wrote an angry letter to the so-called engineers at Denon.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Denon AKDL1 Dedicated Link Cable (Discontinued by Manufacturer)","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VDnWJV9BL._SX300_QL70_.jpg"}
