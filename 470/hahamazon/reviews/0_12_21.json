REAL blades; not flimsy wire.  Blades are firm and SHARP!  They will cut- not SQUASH the fruit- the way some of the cheaper slicers with wire blades will.  I primarily use this to prepare strawberries for dehydrating, and consistently receive evenly sliced berries.  I can easily slice 5 pounds of strawberries in less than 10 minutes.  Clean up is easy- just watch those blades because they are sharp.  You cannot go wrong if you purchase this.","upvotes":0,"downvotes":0,"productTitle":"Chef'n Strawberry Slicester Hand-Held Strawberry Slicer","imageUrl":"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LXsBc0ERL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg"}
