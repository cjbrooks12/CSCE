Got this chair for my new apartment, and it was great for one week until the arm broke. I'm not a big person, 5'8"/130, so I was surprised when the arm just snapped when I pushed on it getting up out of the seat. I read the other comments about the padding and height, but since I'm on the lighter side I figured I could make it work. The back is short, and the padding is a bit thin, but both are relatively good at this price point. If not for this defect it would be a solid chair at a reasonable price. I don't seem to be the only one with the arm-break issue, just be aware of the realities of cheaper products.

Also, it's annoying that the only options for full refund or replacement require you to send the item back - a desk chair isn't exactly the easiest thing to ship back.

Update: Called Amazon, was able to get a partial refund and keep the broken chair, but was surprised that I couldn't just get a replacement part for the broken arm. I sort of assumed that since it was their brand (AmazonBasics) that they'd have an army of these things and their corresponding parts for replacements, but that's apparently not an option. Silver lining is that luckily mine broke within a week so I was still able to get Amazon's help with the partial refund, but next time I shop on Amazon I think I'll be avoiding anything branded AmazonBasics.
