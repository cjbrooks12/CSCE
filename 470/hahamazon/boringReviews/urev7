I love the simplicity of the light. It comes on when you get pretty close and then only stays on for a few seconds after it no longer senses motion. This LED motion sensor light was extremely easy to install, without tools, and even easier to use. It will not come on if there is good light, so it saves energy. I think the batteries (4 AAA) should last a long time considering the energy saving measures. I am happy about that this came with a full 12 month warranty and is backed by a 30 day money back guarantee.... although I have zero complaints and will be keeping this. I am considering buying a few more to add to every closet and outdoor porch steps.
