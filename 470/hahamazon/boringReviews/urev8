Good bike and good value. I am on a budget and I purchased this bike to commute to work and it has been doing a good job so far. Everything on the classified adds around the bay area cost about the same for something used or much more. The box arrived slightly damaged but contents were ok. It was pretty easy to assemble without help and with some basic tools. Brakes, seat, wheels and handle bar were quick to install and adjust and I went off for a quick ride. Did some more adjusting and left the derailleurs for another day which did need adjusting. Day two I spent about two hours adjusting both derailleurs, I was doing it incorrectly so I had to start over couple of times, after watching some quick instructional videos I got it done. In the end I got that working fine and learned how to do it. I think any bike you don't buy at the expensive bike shop is going to need adjusting, it did not discourage me and some things were not easy but I got it done with basic tools and willingness to learn. It does not have a perfect score for me since some things were not great. Brakes were pretty bad so I picked up some cheap replacements at my local store, about 5 a pair for me. The seat is not very comfortable and I ordered a new one right away. Other components seem budget as well and I expect to replace them soon like the handlebar tape and tires. The pedals were a bit small but I will keep them for now. I wear a 10.5 and the ball of my foot sometimes rubs the pedal bar. The grip shifters work ok but I can see how some don't like them. The take up a lot of space and there is not much room for other things like most headlights. Overall its a good purchase I would buy again, just expect like me that you will probably end up spending a bit more on some things you might not like about it. Don't listen to all the folks who say its trash... Those people rather spend lots of money for quick satisfaction.
