This book consists of a number of practical recommendations to make use of elegant C++ features that many C++ programmers, like me, have only vague understanding and sometimes prefer sticking to the old fashion. The book also gives readers detailed descriptions of _why_ the C++ committee has added the feature into C++11/14, _how_ it works internally, and the benefits programmers receive in an enjoyable writing style with lots of examples. Unlike the dry cold C++ standard which is not readable for most human being, this book is a perfect guide to master modern C++ and to be a better C++ programmer.

I should elaborate one thing for people who consider purchasing this book. This book does NOT immediately give you a solution to the piece of code you are developing, the bug you are fighting, or the homework you have to turn in this week. That's not what this book is about. Instead, this book helps you cultivate your internals as a C++ programmer to write more correct, compact, and maintainable code, which you would appreciate over time, not today.
