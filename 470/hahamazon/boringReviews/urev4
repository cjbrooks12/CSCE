Hurricane season begins here in Florida on June 1st and this is "THE" bottled water I am going to stock up on for my hurricane preparedness. Not only does Glaceau smartwater taste exceptionally well, it is vapor distilled for purity.

I prefer drinking distilled water over the very hard tap water we have here in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. Pure water has a pH value of 7.0 making it neutral, meaning that it produces neither acidifying or alkalizing effects within the body when it is consumed.

Glaceau distilled water has added electrolytes of calcium chloride, magnesium chloride and potassium bicarbonate for superior taste and it is the very best distilled water I have ever tasted. Bicarbonate and alkalizing forms of calcium and magnesium have been shown to reduce both urinary calcium loss and bone breakdown. Furthermore the added alkalizing minerals and bicarbonates contained in the water are much more easily assimilated by the body and improve hydration.

Another consideration if you are a coffee drinker like me - it's also a very good idea to drink plenty of pure filtered water such as Glaceau smartwater. Coffee, even decaffeinated coffee, is very acidifying, causing a loss of minerals in the urine and contributes to a lack of hydration. I have noticed that by drinking more of this Glaceau smartwater my need for coffee has decreased as my energy level naturally starts to rise.

This is all very important to me, particularly as a Florida resident facing another hurricane season, making Glaceau smartwater an essential item in my personal disaster kit.
