So I purchased both the first and second version of this speaker. When I say first and second, I don't mean the robot voice version. I'm speaking of the ones that costs $28 and $35, respectively. I wish I had known there was a second one when I purchased the first one. That small but significant detail is something that I missed until later when I looked at this page again. So my curiosity got the best of me and I purchased the second one and WOW. Although the first one is an amazing speaker that's pretty dang loud and has a good amount of bass, I would definitely rather invest $7 and pay for MagicBoxII.

The first one is light, very compatible, comes in various colors, the bass is there, the highs are satisfactory, and it's loud enough where you're not on full blast most of the time. In other words it's a great speaker that will not disappoint.

The second is the same size, heavier (which probably means it has a bigger magnet), it only comes in black, the highs are great, the mids are definitely more apparent, and as a bass junkie, I love the amount of bass this emits. I've played around with the $200 Bose one that has substantial weight and the bass is on-point. So I have pretty high standards for bluetooth speakers. But for less than $40, this is obviously a much better purchase.

Invest in the second one. It's only $7 more. That's almost an hour of work at a minimum wage job for a much better speaker.
