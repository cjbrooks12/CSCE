Okay so I have both of the wands, big and small, and I love both of them! Reason I have both is because I like the curls they give me and don't want the same kind every day. I got the smaller one for Christmas and ordered the bigger one right after and they are amazing. I know a lot of people wonder which size to get so I curled the sides of my hair with both wands and that's what happened. The bigger one is more for like loose waves while the smaller one is curlier. Before I asked for a wand (these are my first wands I've ever used and owned) I watched a ton of YouTube tutorials on styles and such so you could do that to get a good idea. But DEFINETLY get these wands. They're inexpesive with long lasting curls and a nice smooth barrel. And a tip for curling your hair is that unless you want the curls/waves to blend together like in my picture try alternating which way you curl. Like curl away from your face, then towards your face, and so on. Also be wary of how big your sections are because that definetly affects the outcome of your curl. I strongly recommend these wands and I got these on my own without an offer for my review so I am unbiased. I just really love these wands and these curls!!
